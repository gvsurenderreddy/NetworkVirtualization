Scenario description:

1. European node planetlab3.ethz.ch starts off as the coordinator.
US node planetlab01.cs.washington.edu, another European node planetlab1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de,
and Asian node planetlab4.ie.cuhk.edu.hk join as members.

2. China node(*.hk) leaves. It sends a LEAV message to coordinator ETH node
which distributes the updated file to US and other European node.

3. US node (*.edu) detects a 'false' timeout of the coordinator ETH node. US node
has a higher rank and it overrides the lower-rank (lexicographically) ETH node and 
itself becomes the new coordinator.

4. The other European node (*.de) leaves. It sends a LEAV message to coordinator
US node. US node distributes updated information to ETH node.

5. Coordinator US node is killed off. Member ETH node detects this and itself becomes 
the new coordinator. Also, the last node standing in overlay
