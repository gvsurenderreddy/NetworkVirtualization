Steps for executing overlay:

1. Start a SimpleHTTPServer on each of the nodes as:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090 1>/dev/null 2>&1 &
Port 9090 is currently hard-coded in the python application, so can't be replaced
with another port number

2. Make sure that files overlay.py, networking.py and seeds.txt
are present in the current directory.

3. Trigger bootstrapping of a node as:
$ python overlay.py -v

Omit -v flag for less verbose logging.
As an alternative, one of the nodes (and only one) node can be started as a coordinator.
Behavior is currently undefined if more than one nodes are started as coordinator.
To start a node as coordinator, use -c flag:
$ python overlay.py -c -v

IMPORTANT FILES:
1. seeds.txt: Should contain the names of all nodes on which overlay has to be 
started.

2. members.txt: Contains nodes currently part of the overlay as seen by this node.

3. latency.txt: Contains latency measurements as measured by this node to other 
members of the overlay.

4. log.txt: Contains log output ('EVENT JOIN', 'EVENT LEAVE' etc.)

KNOWN BUGS/IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Currently, access to the members.txt file is not coordinated between threads. Locking
mechanism needs to be implemented for safe access.
2. The global 'Coordinator' should perhaps be replaced as with increase in code-size, it
becomes difficult to track read/write to the global variable.
